# Coding Interview Practice AI Assistant

This Hugging Face Space is a coding interview practice application built with Gradio and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. It simulates a coding interview environment where candidates can practice solving problems under the guidance of an AI interviewer. The AI provides problems, analyzes solutions, and offers feedback without giving direct hints unless explicitly requested.

## Features

- **Customizable Practice Sessions:** Candidates can select the difficulty level, topic, and programming language for their practice session.
- **Real-time Feedback:** As candidates submit their solutions, the AI provides feedback on the code's complexity, potential improvements, and errors.
- **Detailed Review:** At the end of the session, the AI gives comprehensive feedback, including detailed reviews of all attempts and suggestions for improvement.

## Using This Space

Access this Gradio application at [Interviewer Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/ilarchenko/interviewer). Hereâ€™s how to use it:

1. **Select Your Preferences:** Use the settings panel to specify the problem requirements, choose the programming language, difficulty level, and topic.
2. **Start the Interview:** Click "Start" to receive a problem tailored to your selections.
3. **Code Your Solution:** Input your code in the provided code editor.
4. **Interact for Feedback:** Submit your code for initial feedback. Use the chat to interact with the AI for further insights and hints.
